It was originally a ruined temple, paired with Wat Chiang Saen, before the construction of Wat Pa Thung. During its construction, various significant artifacts were discovered, including ancient Buddha images and valuable items.

Inside the ordination hall, there is the mortuary urn of the revered monk, Luang Pu La, Tathip, who, even after his passing, has not decayed, allowing believers to pay their respects. Luang Pu La, or Phra Khru Chan Som, was born during the reign of King Rama V, between September 22, 2441, in Ban Pong, On Tai Subdistrict, San Kamphaeng District, Chiang Mai Province. At the age of 8, he was entrusted to the care of Teacher Pintata, the abbot of Wat Pa Thung. This marked his first opportunity for formal education, which continued until the age of 11. He then ordained as a novice during the initiation ceremony and resided in the forest, a significant ritual known as 'entering the monastic life.' Luang Pu La adhered strictly to the monastic disciplines to alleviate worldly desires. When he turned 18, he left for monastic studies in Chiang Mai. However, he had to return to Wat Pa Thung after the sudden demise of Teacher Pintata in 2467. Luang Pu La then assumed the position of the abbot and was later appointed the monastic title of Phra Khru Chan Sommanakhun in 2467 when he was 63 years old. He passed away peacefully at the age of 97 on February 16, 2536. Wat Pa Thung is located in On Tai Subdistrict, San Kamphaeng District, Chiang Mai Province."}
